# Features
[SeaweedFS](https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs) is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system and started by implementing [Facebook's Haystack design paper](http://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf). SeaweedFS is currently growing, with more features on the way.

This Java client is encapsulates the functionality full of the SeaweedFS API and provides a simple interface.

For performance, we make some progress:
* Include [Ehcache](https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3) and used it for cached lookup volume.
* Include [HttpClient](https://github.com/apache/httpclient) Connection Pool for handle HTTP request.
* Volume server location load balance.
* Heuristic cache is used for fetch file stream.
* Auto switch leader server (master) at failover.

# Quick Start

##### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.lokra.seaweedfs</groupId>
  <artifactId>seaweedfs-client</artifactId>
  <version>0.7.3.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

##### Gradle
```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile('org.lokra.seaweedfs:seaweedfs-client:0.7.3.RELEASE')
}
```

##### Create a connection manager
```java
FileSource fileSource = new FileSource();
// SeaweedFS master server host
fileSource.setHost("localhost");
// SeaweedFS master server port
fileSource.setPort(9333);
// Startup manager and listens for the change
fileSource.startup();
```

##### Create a file operation template
```java
// Template used with connection manager
FileTemplate template = new FileTemplate(fileSource.getConnection());
template.saveFileByStream("filename.doc", someFile);
```
